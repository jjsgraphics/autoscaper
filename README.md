# autoscaper
Supports Maya 2019 (other versions may be unstable/broken due to different python version)

# how to use
Run the code in the Maya script editor.

# changing the tree models
import any obj file
rename it to 'tallTreeOBJ' or 'smallTreeOBJ'
(the tall trees generate on higher up surfaces)
(move them far away so they can't be seen)
